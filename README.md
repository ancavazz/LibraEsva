# LibraEsva BlockedList

This is the list of blocked domains in my Libra Esva antispam server installation. The list is updated weekly based on the reports generated from the received emails.  
If you have a single domain installation, you can leave the 'default' parameter in the domain column. In the case of a multi-domain setup, you must replace 'default' with your domain for which you want to block.
